### 5.1.0 (2017-12-11)

Decided, the simplest interface for opening and closing a database is the `Skull` object itself. Creating the object opens the database, dismissing the object closes the database.

### 5.0.0 (2017-09-29)

Welcome back, this is mostly a housekeeping release. Update to Swift 4 and build with Xcode 9. Update package to [PackageDescription API Version 4](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/master/Documentation/PackageDescriptionV4.md). The tests have been refined, the fastest way to run them is `swift test`. Also, I‘ve added a simple example, built with the Package Manager.

### 4.0.4 (2016-11-09)

Build with Xcode 8.1 adopting recommended settings and set `SWIFT_INCLUDE_PATHS` conditionally to find the correct module map for each platform including the different simulators.

### 4.0.3 (2016-10-29)

Correct iOS deployment target and version.

### 4.0.2 (2016-10-29)

Minor adjustments resulting from dogfooding.

- [`57e9d15`](https://github.com/michaelnisi/skull/commit/57e9d15c247fc68c235ae90f643af520fac96b39)
Complying with Apple’s recommendation to support the latest two majors, this sets the iOS deployment target to 9.0.

- [`17cdd5f`](https://github.com/michaelnisi/skull/commit/17cdd5feeed31670a26d5ec3b7d391accbca8ded)
Type SkullRow value as Any.

### 4.0.1 (2016-10-20)

A quick release improving the `README` and practicing writing this `CHANGELOG`—it’s quite likely that I won’t be doing this for long. Let’s see!

- [`a3784c3`](https://github.com/michaelnisi/skull/commit/a3784c39052468a4457b53e823ab74136790a34b)
Add a wonky Einstein citation and try to make it clearer that you have to generate the module maps before you can build the framework with Xcode. Also, as I just realized, a modification of the tvOS scheme has slipped in, which I’m not sure about. I hope it’s a leftover that should have been in the previous release.

### 4.0.0 (2016-10-11)

This release is mainly about migrating to Swift 3, but I've also found it timely to adopt Swift Package Manager conventions.

Being able to drop the C helpers, thanks to Swift 3 support of C function pointer callbacks, is my favorite in this release.
